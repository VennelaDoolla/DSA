Problem Description :

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
Example 2:

Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]

Source Code:

class Solution(object):
    def findRepeatedDnaSequences(self, s):
        hash=defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(len(s)-9):
            hash[s[i:i+10]]+=1
        ans=[]
        for i in hash.keys():
            if hash[i]>1:
                ans.append(i)
        return ans
